        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                For my album <strong>"Something New"</strong>, I designed and developed a <strong>custom landing page</strong> that serves as both a 
                <strong>promotional tool</strong> and a <strong>visual extension of my brand identity</strong>. The goal was to create a site that seamlessly 
                integrates with the album’s aesthetic, ensuring a <strong>cohesive experience</strong> across all touchpoints.
            </p>
            <ul class="about-list">
                <li><strong>Project Type:</strong> Album Landing Page</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish a striking first impression while maintaining brand consistency</li>
                <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li><strong>Live Project:</strong> <a href="https://corvus-echoes.com/albums/something-new" target="_blank">Visit the Website</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Design Approach -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Design Approach</h2>

            <h3>Minimalist UI with Strong Branding</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of a traditional, cluttered landing page, I focused on <strong>deliberate simplicity</strong>—keeping only essential 
                elements while making sure they felt meaningful. Every detail, from typography to animations, was chosen to reinforce the 
                <strong>mystique and depth of the album’s identity</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Balancing Desktop & Mobile Experiences</h3>
            <p>
                One of the biggest design considerations was ensuring the <strong>experience translated well between desktop and mobile</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul class="about-list">
                <li>The <strong>album cover is meant to feel “in front” of everything else</strong>, creating depth and immersion.</li>
                <li>On <strong>desktop</strong>, I achieved this using a <strong>3D hover effect</strong> tied to mouse movement.</li>
                <li>On <strong>mobile</strong>, I replaced this with a <strong>gentle, continuous rotation</strong> that maintains motion without requiring user interaction.</li>
            </ul>

                <img src="album_mobile.gif" alt="Mobile Animation Effect">
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Development & Technical Considerations -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Development & Technical Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <p>
                The project was built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. I ensured that all elements remained <strong>lightweight and fast-loading</strong>,
                which is critical for an effective landing page.
            </p>

            <h3>Navigation & Interactions</h3>
            <ul class="about-list">
                <li>The <strong>Corvus Echoes logo</strong> in the top-left corner subtly <strong>grows on hover</strong>, indicating it serves as a button back to the main site.</li>
                <li>The overall layout and structure are <strong>intuitive and fluid</strong>, ensuring users can quickly access key information <strong>without distractions</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Performance & Optimization</h3>
            <p>
                While no advanced optimizations were needed, I ensured the page remained <strong>low-bandwidth</strong> for fast load times, which is 
                <strong>critical for first impressions</strong>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Tracklist -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Tracklist Presentation</h2>
            <p>
                The tracklist needed to be presented in a way that felt interactive while maintaining a clean, atmospheric aesthetic.
                I opted for a <strong>subtle alternating background effect</strong> that subtly animates on mouse hover to visually separate each song.
            </p>

        <!-- Video Player -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Embedded Media</h2>
            <p>
                To create a truly immersive landing page, I incorporated my 3D-Animated music video as an embedded video directly onto the site.
                This allows users to immediately engage with the album’s visual and auditory elements.
            </p>

                <img src="video-player.png" alt="Embedded Video Player Screenshot">
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Final Thoughts -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Final Thoughts & Reflection</h2>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ul class="about-list">
                <li>How to <strong>translate a brand identity into an interactive digital space</strong>.</li>
                <li>How to <strong>optimize motion design</strong> for both desktop and mobile users.</li>
                <li>How a <strong>minimalist UI</strong> can still be <strong>highly engaging and immersive</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
            <p>
                If I were to expand this project, I’d love to introduce <strong>more interactive elements</strong>—allowing users to <strong>engage with the album</strong> in 
                new, unique ways. Whether through <strong>audio-reactive visuals, interactive storytelling, or experimental motion graphics</strong>, there are endless possibilities 
                for <strong>taking this experience even further</strong>.
